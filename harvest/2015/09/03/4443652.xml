Previously, we have demonstrated that solenopsin exhibit anti-angiogenic activity and downregulate phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) in the p53 deficient renal cell carcinoma cell line 786-O.

          <title>Methods</title>
          <p>Different analogs of solenopsin were synthesized in order to explore structure-activity relationships. The anti-proliferative effect of solenopsin and analogs was tested on six different cell lines, including three tumor cell lines, two normal cutaneous cell lines, and one immortalized hyperproliferative cell line. FRET-based reporters were used to study the affect of solenopsin and analogs on Akt activity and PDK1 activation and sucrose density gradient fractionation was performed to examine recruitment of PTEN to membrane rafts. Western-blotting was used to evaluate the affect of solenopsin and analogs on the Akt and the MAPK 44/42 pathways in three different tumor cell lines. Measurement of cellular oxygen consumption rate together with autophagy staining was performed to study mitochondrial function. Finally, the affect of solenopsin and analogs on ROS production was investigated.</p>

          <title>Results</title>
          <p>In this paper we demonstrate that solenopsin analogs with potent anti-proliferative effects can be synthesized from inexpensive dimethylpyridines. To determine whether solenopsin and analogs act as ceramide analogs, we examined the effect of solenopsin and analogs on two stereotypic sites of ceramide activity, namely at lipid rafts and mitochondria. We found that native solenopsin, (−)-solenopsin A, inhibits functional Akt activity and PDK1 activation in lipid rafts in a similar fashion as ceramide. Both <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> analogs of solenopsin reduce mitochondrial oxygen consumption, increase reactive oxygen, and kill tumor cells with elevated levels of Akt phosphorylation. However, only solenopsin induces mitophagy, like ceramide.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>The requirements for ceramide induced mitophagy and inhibition of Akt activity and PDK1 activation in lipid rafts are under strict stereochemical control. The naturally occurring (−)-solenopsin A mimic some of the functions of ceramide and may be therapeutically useful in the treatment of hyperproliferative and malignant disorders of the skin, even in the presence of elevated levels of Akt.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>(−)-Solenopsin A is a piperidine alkaloid that is a component of the venom of the fire ant <italic>Solenopsis invicta</italic>. Previously, we demonstrated that solenopsin exhibited anti-angiogenic activity and downregulated phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) in the p53 deficient renal cell carcinoma cell line 786-O [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Solenopsin structurally resembles ceramides in chemical structure (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Ceramides are fatty acid amides of sphingosine, which play a crucial role in homeostasis of the skin and other organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Defects in the production of ceramides may inhibit physiologic cell death, leading to the persistence of inflammatory and neoplastic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Large-scale extraction of solenopsin from fire ants is not feasible, and current synthetic routes are multistep routes with low yields. Thus, we devised a simple two-step synthesis of solenopsin analogs starting from inexpensive dimethyl pyridine. We examined the effect of solenopsin and analogs on two stereotypic sites of ceramide activity, lipid rafts and mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. We show that native (−)-solenopsin A has ceramide-like activity in lipid rafts and mitochondria. Finally, we show that solenopsin and analogs kill tumor cells regardless of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) status or Akt activation. Given that loss of PTEN and elevation of Akt are major mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], the use of solenopsin and analogs may be of great utility in treating hyperproliferative skin disorders.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Compounds studied in this paper and synthetic procedures for preparation of compounds S11-S15. (−)-Solenopsin A is a component of the venom of the fire ant solenopsis invicta. (+)-Solenopsin A is the enantiomer of the naturally occurring solenopsin. The structure of solenopsin resembles the structure of ceramides, which are fatty acid amides of sphingosine that play a crucial role in homeostasis of the skin and other organs. Solenopsin analogs <bold>S11</bold>-<bold>S14</bold> were synthesized by deprotonation of 2,6-dimethylpyridine <bold>(S12</bold>-<bold>S14)</bold> or 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine <bold>(S11)</bold> by <italic>n</italic>-butyllithiium, followed by addition of alkyl bromides.

        <p>A375, A2058, SVR, primary melanocyte, primary keratinocyte, and HaCaT cells were treated with test compounds for 24 hours, followed by cell counting with a Coulter Counter. All compounds were tested in quadruplicates. For A375s, A2058s, SVRs, and primary melanocytes 50,000 cells/well were plated. Due to difficulty growing the cells, primary keratinocytes and HaCaTs were plated at a concentration of 20,000 cells/well, and 15,000 cells/well respectively. All cells were treated with 20 μM of ceramide C2. A375s, A2058s, and SVRs were treated with 10 μM of (−)-solenopsin A, (+)-solenopsin A, or analogs <bold>S11</bold>-<bold>S15</bold>, whereas primary melanocytes, primary keratinocytes, and HaCaTs were treated with 20 μM of solenopsin and analogs.</p>

        <title>Structure-activity relationships of solenopsin and analogs</title>
        <p>Different analogs of solenopsin were synthesized (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) in order to explore structure-activity relationships. Three different tumor cell lines, relevant for skin, were used to assess anti-proliferative potency: human A375 melanoma cells, human A2058 melanoma cells, and murine SVR angiosarcoma cells. No significant difference between the naturally occurring compound, (−)-solenopsin A, and its enantiomer (+)-solenopsin A could be seen in any of the tumor cell lines (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Both of these compounds have <italic>trans</italic> geometry. The mixture of the two <italic>cis</italic> isomers of solenopsin, <bold>S12</bold>, show weaker anti-proliferative activity than (−)-solenopsin A in all three cell lines (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), suggesting that the <italic>trans</italic> isomers are more potent than the corresponding <italic>cis</italic> isomers. Elongation of the aliphatic side chain with 8 carbons had a negative effect on potency, as analogs <bold>S11</bold> and <bold>S13</bold> displayed a lower anti-proliferative effect than both solenopsin and <bold>S12</bold>. Also, the only compound that showed no anti-proliferative effect in any of the cell lines was <bold>S11</bold>, which in addition to having the longest aliphatic side chain also has an extra methyl group on the piperidine ring. Interestingly, analog <bold>S14</bold>, which has a 4 carbon longer aliphatic side chain than solenopsin, turned out to be the most potent analog in human melanoma A375 cells and murine angiosarcoma SVR cells (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a and b). As <bold>S14</bold> was significantly more potent than <bold>S12</bold> in all three cell lines, it would appear as if a 15-carbon side chain is the optimum length for anti-proliferative activity. <bold>S15</bold>, which has the same length side chain as solenopsin but lacks the methyl group and has an extra hydroxyl group, also displayed potent anti-proliferative effect in all three cell lines and in human melanoma A2058 cells it was the most potent analog.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Assessment of anti-proliferative activity for solenopsin and analogs S11-S15.

        <p>The effect of ceramide, solenopsin A, and analogs <bold>S11</bold>-<bold>S15</bold> was also assessed on two normal cutaneous cell lines, namely primary melanocytes and primary keratinocytes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). In addition, the activity of the compounds was assessed in HaCaTs, which are immortalized hyperproliferative human keratinocytes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). The analogs <bold>S11</bold> and <bold>S13</bold>, which were inactive in the tumor cell lines, did not have any activity in these cell lines either. Ceramide only showed activity in primary melanocytes and keratinocytes (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1), but not in malignant A375s, A2058s, and SVRs, (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Interestingly, HaCat cells, which represent premalignant keratinocytes, are resistant to ceramide, supporting our hypothesis that loss of response to ceramide may represent an early event in skin carcinogenesis.

        <title>Solenopsin inhibits functional Akt activity and PDK1 activation</title>
        <p>Ceramides are found in the cell membrane where they act as signaling molecules and play a role in a variety of physiological conditions, such as: differentiation, proliferation, programmed cell death, apoptosis etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The underlying mechanisms are complex and the exact means by which ceramides function as signaling molecules are not clear. However, there are a number of studies that show that ceramide inhibit the PI3K/Akt pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. To determine whether solenopsin A and analogs have similar modes of action as ceramide, we employed a FRET-based Akt activity reporter (AktAR) and a PDK1 activation reporter targeted to membrane rafts (Lyn-PARE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The AktAR construct contains a binding domain (FHA1), a substrate domain (FOXO), and two fluorescent proteins that constitute a FRET pair. This reporter functions as surrogate substrate for Akt and phosphorylation of the substrate leads to a detectable change in FRET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Lyn-PARE contains the full-length PDK1 protein flanked by two fluorescent proteins that constitute a FRET pair. This construct also contains a motif derived from Lyn-kinase, which targets it to membrane rafts. Activation of PDK1 leads to a conformational change and thereby a detectable change in FRET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Previously, these reporters have been used to show that ceramide treatment inhibits PDGF-induced Akt activity and activation of PDK1 in membrane rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. At 20 μM concentrations both (+)- and (−)-solenopsin A inhibited Akt activity (AktAR) and PDK1 activation (Lyn-PARE) to similar extent as treatment with 50 μM of ceramide (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). At 10 μM concentrations some inhibition of Akt activity and PDK1 activation could be seen for both (+)- and (−)-solenopsin A. At 10 μM <bold>S13</bold> and possibly also <bold>S12</bold> displayed some inhibition of Akt activity and PDK1 activation. No significant inhibition could be seen for any of the other solenopsin analogs (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Solenopsin A inhibits Akt activity (AktAR) and PDK1 activation (Lyn-PARE).

        <title>Translocation of PTEN to membrane rafts</title>
        <p>To examine whether solenopsin recruits PTEN to membrane rafts, as ceramide does, sucrose density gradient fractionation was performed followed by evaluation of the PTEN levels in each fraction. PTEN negatively regulates the PI3K/Akt signaling, which takes place in the lipid raft regions, by converting PIP<sub>3</sub> (phosphatidylinostol (3,4,5)-triphosphate) to PIP<sub>2</sub> (phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-biphosphate). As most PTEN is usually localized to nonraft regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], studies suggest that ceramide inhibits PI3K/Akt signaling by translocating PTEN from nonraft regions into lipid rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p>
        <p>As expected, the amounts of PTEN seem to be higher in lipid raft fractions from cells treated with ceramide (fraction 1–4) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). The compound that appeared to have the largest amount of PTEN in the raft fractions was (−)-solenopsin A (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). (+)-solenopsin A and <bold>S12</bold>-treated cells showed similar amounts of PTEN in the raft fractions as the ceramide treated cells (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). The rest of the analogs (<bold>S13</bold>-<bold>S15</bold>) appeared to have similar or even lower amounts of PTEN in lipid rafts than the control (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). It is worth pointing out that for these experiments the use of a loading control is not possible. Therefore, these results should only be regarded as an indication of the compounds ability to recruit PTEN to membrane rafts. However, the FRET-based analysis was largely consistent with the PTEN localization as demonstrated by sucrose density fractionation.</p>

The results for the human melanoma A2058 cells were similar to A375 cells but not as pronounced, i.e. there is a slight up-regulation of p-Akt S473 and p-MAPK 44/42 in some of the treatment groups compared to the control. Both human melanoma cell lines (A375 and A2058) have intact p53 and loss of p16ink4a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], whereas the murine angiosarcoma cell line (SVR) has defective p53 function due to the presence of SV40 large T antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

        <title>Solenopsin A and analogs affect mitochondrial function</title>
        <p>Although solenopsin A recruits PTEN to lipid rafts (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3), it does not appear to be enough to dephosphorylate Akt (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4) in the human melanoma cell lines A375 and A2058 (both are wild type p53) like it did in 786-O renal cell carcinoma cells (mutant p53) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. One explanation for the anti-proliferative activity of solenopsin and analogs could be that they, like ceramide, also localize to mitochondria and increase the production of reactive oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], thereby causing mitophagy and cell death. Cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) can be indicative of mitochondrial function. To investigate if solenopsin A and analogs alter mitochondrial function in human head and neck squamous carcinoma cells like ceramide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], UM-SCC1A cells were treated with 10 μM of solenopsin and analogs, followed by incubation for 24 hours. Cells treated with (+)- and (−)-solenopsin A, <bold>S12</bold>, <bold>S14</bold>, and <bold>S15</bold> displayed reduced OCR compared to control, while cells treated with <bold>S13</bold> have slightly reduced OCR and cells treated with <bold>S11</bold> show little change in OCR compared to the control (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). To verify that mitophagy is the reason for the observed decrease in OCR, a Cyto-ID Autophagy Staining assay was used. The dye stains autophagosomes and co-localizes with LC3-II.

A significant increase in fluorescence could be seen for (−)-solenopsin A compared to the control, which verifies that (−)-solenopsin A induces autophagy (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5). Analog <bold>S14</bold>, on the other hand, does not appear to induce autophagy; instead it looks as if <bold>S14</bold> may even decrease basal levels of autophagy (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Solenopsin A and analogs reduce oxygen consumption rate.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Ceramides play a role in physiologic cell death, as they are involved in removal of undesired cells, and thus limit both inflammation and neoplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Ceramides have also been implicated in mediating cell death due to chemotherapy and radiation, and inability to generate ceramides is linked to resistance to these treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Thus, restoration of ceramide is a potential anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory modality, but is complicated by difficult synthesis, low stability and rapid metabolism. Therefore, analogs that do not suffer from these disadvantages could be therapeutically beneficial. We noted the similarity of solenopsin to ceramide and hypothesized that solenopsin and analogs might act as ceramide-like agonists. We thus evaluated their ceramide-like activity at both the lipid membrane and mitochondria.</p>
      <p>A major obstacle to the widespread use of solenopsin is obtaining sufficient quantities for preclinical and clinical studies. Extraction of solenopsin from ants is not feasible, and therefore large scale synthesis is required. All current synthetic methods suffer from reliance on expensive reagents and multiple steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In this paper, we demonstrate that solenopsin analogs can be synthesized by lithiation of inexpensive industrial dimethylpyridines, followed by alkylation of the lithiated pyridines with alkyl halides, which can be varied. Finally, the alkylated pyridine is hydrogenated to give the solenopsin analogs (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Each of these steps is amenable to scale up for industrial production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In a previous study by our group we showed that solenopsin analogs with shorter aliphatic side chains lacked anti-proliferative activity in murine angiosarcoma SVR cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Here we demonstrate that solenopsin analogs with 8 carbon longer side chains (<bold>S11</bold> and <bold>S13</bold>) also lack significant anti-proliferative activity in murine SVR angiosarcoma and human melanoma (A375 and A2058) cells. On the other hand, <bold>S14</bold>, which has a 4 carbon longer side chain, and <bold>S15</bold>, which has the same length side-chain but contains a hydroxyl group and lacks the methyl group, are equally as potent as (−)-solenopsin A in all three cell lines. Thus, optimal length of the aliphatic side chain appears to be associated with high anti-proliferative activity.</p>
      <p>One of the modes of ceramide’s activity is downregulation of Akt, a serine-threonine kinase that plays a central role in protecting tumor cells from apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Akt, which originally was discovered as a viral oncogene, has transforming activity in multiple cell types. PTEN is a tumor suppressor that inhibits Akt activation in lipid rafts. We used A375 human melanoma cells, which express wild type PTEN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], to assess the effect of solenopsin A on PTEN localization. Indeed, solenopsin A did appear to cause relocalization of PTEN to lipid rafts (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). FRET-based reporters were used to show that solenopsin A inhibits Akt activity (AktAR) and PDK1 activation (Lyn-PARE) in lipid rafts to the same extent as ceramide in NIH3T3 murine embryonic fibroblast cells (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Unexpectedly, we found that solenopsin A increases Akt phosphorylation in cells with wild type p53 (A375 and A2058), while it decreases Akt activation in cells with defective p53 function (SVR and 786-O) (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S4), thus demonstrating a context dependent effect on tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Taken together it appears as if relocalization of PTEN to lipid rafts is insufficient to block Akt activation, at least in cells with wild type p53. In addition, solenopsin A is highly effective in killing A375 human melanoma cells, despite no reduction of Akt phosphorylation. This implies that solenopsin’s killing of tumor cells with wild type PTEN may not depend exclusively on Akt deactivation, but may involve additional events, such as mitochondrial induced cell death. Indeed, investigation of solenopsin and analogs affect on OCR-levels revealed a similar trend as the proliferation assays. Solenopsin A and the analogs <bold>S12</bold>, <bold>S14</bold> and <bold>S15</bold> all markedly decreased the OCR levels (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) in UM-SCC1A cells. Interestingly, autophagy staining showed that (−)-solenopsin A (<italic>trans</italic> geometry) but not <bold>S14</bold> (<italic>cis</italic> geometry) induced mitophagy (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S5), indicating strict stereochemical requirements for induction of mitophagy. Thus, the <italic>trans</italic> geometry is not essential for anti-proliferative activity, although it appears to be required for ceramide-like mitophagy activity. Further, our study of superoxide levels displayed a similar pattern as the proliferation and OCR assays, i.e. solenopsin A, <bold>S12</bold>, <bold>S14</bold> and <bold>S15</bold> substantially increased superoxide, whereas <bold>S11</bold> and <bold>S13</bold> showed no effect (Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> is a suggested model, based on our results, which show the effect of ceramide and solenopsin on cell function. The FDA requires all new topical and transdermal products to be evaluated for skin irritation and sensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. A 3D cell culture of human skin keratinocytes has been evaluated by European Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods as an alternative to the rabbit draize test, to avoid animal usage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In our study, solenopsin and analogs <bold>S12</bold>, <bold>S14</bold> were found to be non-irritant (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2). Thus, solenopsin and analogs have the potential for further development for topical treatment of both tumors and inflammatory disorders that are deficient in ceramide.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>A model for the effect of Ceramide and Solenopsin on cell function.

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>In this work we show that the naturally occurring (−)-solenopsin A exhibit ceramide-like biological activity in human melanoma cell lines and could therefore be useful in treating hyperproliferative skin disorders. First, we demonstrate that native (−)-solenopsin A mimics canonical functions of ceramide on cells, namely inhibition of Akt activity and PDK1 activation in lipid rafts as well as induction of mitophagy (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Differences in <italic>cis-trans</italic> geometry and chain length abrogate these functions. Second, the response to solenopsin differs in cells of various genetic backgrounds, with no effect or elevation of Akt phosphorylation in cells with wild type p53 (A375, A2058), while decreasing Akt phosphorylation in cells with defective p53 (SVR, 786-O). Solenopsin and analogs are also effective in killing cells with elevated Akt phosphorylation, which is an adverse prognostic factor in most cancers. Based upon the novel hypothesis that restoration of ceramide-like signaling may be beneficial in the treatment of neoplastic and hyperproliferative skin disorders, our assessment of solenopsin and analogs on normal cutaneous cells and premalignant cells demonstrate the potential of solenopsin and analogs to treat hyperproliferative disorders when compared to ceramide.</p>
