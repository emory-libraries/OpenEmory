      <abstract>
        <p>Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) have a dismal prognosis and are poorly understood brain cancers. Receptor tyrosine kinases stabilized by neuron-glial antigen 2 (NG2) protein are known to induce gliomagenesis. Here, we investigated NG2 expression in a cohort of DIPG specimens (n= 50). We demonstrate NG2 expression in the majority of DIPG specimens tested and determine that tumors harboring histone 3.3 mutation express the highest NG2 levels. We further demonstrate that microRNA 129-2 (miR129-2) is downregulated and hypermethylated in human DIPGs, resulting in the increased expression of NG2. Treatment with 5-Azacytidine, a methyltransferase inhibitor, results in NG2 downregulation in DIPG primary tumor cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. NG2 expression is altered (symmetric segregation) in mitotic human DIPG and mouse tumor cells. These mitotic cells co-express oligodendrocyte (Olig2) and astrocyte (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) markers, indicating lack of terminal differentiation. NG2 knockdown retards cellular migration <italic>in vitro,</italic> while NG2 expressing neurospheres are highly tumorigenic <italic>in vivo,</italic> resulting in rapid growth of pontine tumors. NG2 expression is targetable <italic>in vivo</italic> using miR129-2 indicating a potential avenue for therapeutic interventions. This data implicates NG2 as a molecule of interest in DIPGs especially those with H3.3 mutation.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Pediatric brainstem gliomas (BSGs) account for 15% of all brain tumors in children [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) are high grade tumors of pons with the peak age of onset of 6-7 years [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Children diagnosed with DIPG have less than 90% chance of survival within two years of diagnosis [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. A pLys27Met (K27M) driver mutation in the <italic>H3F3A</italic> gene of histone 3 variant 3 (H3.3) and <italic>HIST1H3B</italic> (H3.1) was recently correlated to a subgroup of DIPG patients with distinct clinical and biological characteristics [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Other genomic aberrations of DIPGs include p53 mutations and amplification of tyrosine receptor kinase/Ras/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathways including platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Our group and others have reported the involvement of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway in a subset of DIPGs [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Modulation of Hh and tyrosine kinase receptors may alter the self-renewal properties of DIPG cells by targeting the self-renewing cancer stem cells (CSC). Receptor tyrosine kinases including PDGFRα are stabilized by the transmembrane protein NG2, also known as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. NG2<sup>+</sup> cells that often co-express PDGFRα and Olig-2 are present in adult gliomas [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], where NG2 contributes to the neoplastic transformation of glioma precursor cells [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. NG2 segregation in dividing oligodendrocytes plays an important role in terminal differentiation and self-renewal properties of these cells [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Specifically, in non-neoplastic tissue, NG2 expression is limited to only one daughter cell. In contrast, in malignant gliomas, NG2 is symmetrically expressed in both daughter cells resulting in active expression of other growth factor receptors including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Despite the potential role of NG2 in EGFR-mediated neoplasm, NG2 expression has not been previously established in pediatric gliomas. We have recently reported elevated mRNA expression of NG2 in a large percentage of pediatric DIPGs [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this study, we determined that NG2 expression is prominent in a majority of our DIPG cohort (n=34) as well as <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> models of DIPG. Our study is the first to demonstrate that: i) NG2 expression is associated with DIPG; ii) NG2 expression is symmetric in mitotic cells resulting in uncommitted progenitors with CSC properties; iii) NG2 in DIPGs is regulated by miR129-2; and iv) NG2 expression can be targeted <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> using miR129-2. Orthotopic injection of NG2 expressing cells results in rapidly developing pontine tumors that co-express PDGFRα, PDGFRβ and Ki67. Identification of NG2 as a protein associated with DIPG may provide novel avenues for development of therapeutic targets to stop proliferation of this highly infiltrative cancer.</p>

        <title>NG2 is upregulated in Human DIPG</title>
        <p>To investigate NG2 expression in DIPGs, we performed immunohistochemical (IHC) staining on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) specimens from DIPG children obtained at postmortem. Histological studies by a neuropathologist indicated NG2 protein upregulation in tumor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>), where NG2 was localized to the cell membrane as expected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>, inset). NG2 expression was not detected in adjacent normal human brainstem (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). To define the frequency of NG2 expression in DIPGs, we used a larger cohort (n = 50) of human specimens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>) for immunohistochemical (IHC) and Western blotting assays. IHC assays using formalin fixed specimens showed NG2 expression in 75% (9 of 12) of DIPGs, with variable expression levels localized to tumor cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). To quantify NG2 upregulation, protein extracts from frozen human DIPG specimens were used for Western blotting assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). NG2 expression in protein extract from 38 human specimens (22 DIPG and 16 adjacent normal) validated NG2 expression in DIPGs [13 of 22 (60 %)] to varying degrees. Low NG2 expression was also detected in four adjacent normal tissue specimens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). This could be attributed to the presence of infiltrating glioma cells or normal NG2 expressing cells within normal brainstem (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). NG2 expression was assessed using densitometry and found to be significant (average fold change = 3, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in tumor compared to normal specimens (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>).</p>

We inspected the correlation of NG2 expression with H3 mutations status in our DIPG cohort (n = 13). We found NG2 to be significantly (p = 0.035) upregulated in H3.3 mutant specimens when compared with specimens with H3.1 mutation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>). No NG2 expression was detected in the only DIPG specimen with wild type histone 3 status.</p>

        <title>NG2 Expression is Upregulated in Preclinical DIPG Models</title>
        <p>To test NG2 expression in preclinical DIPG murine models, we used IHC to assess NG2 expression in the PDGFB-Ink4a-ARF<sup>−/−</sup> mouse (PDGFB model) [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] as well as mouse injected with glioma cells derived from PDGFB/p53<sup>−/−</sup>/H3.3K27M model [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We show significant upregulation of NG2 in both PDGFB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>) and PDGFB/p53<sup>−/−</sup>/H3.3K27M (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>) DIPG mouse models. Low NG2 expression was detected in normal adjacent brainstem regions as well as the cerebellum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b and 2d</xref>). High level (148 fold, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) of NG2 was also detected by Western blot assays using tumor (n = 3) and normal (n = 3) brainstem specimens obtained from PDGFB mouse model or healthy controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2a</xref>). Furthermore, we tested NG2 expression in three primary human DIPG lines (SF8628, SUDIPGIV and SUDIPGVI) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2b</xref>). All three primary cells showed NG2 expression as assessed by Western blotting assays.</p>

        <title>NG2 is Regulated by microRNA 129-2</title>
        <p>To investigate potential molecular mechanism of NG2 regulation, we used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software, which generates biologic pathways based on published molecular interactions [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. IPA analysis identified miR129-2 as a potential NG2 regulator. To validate NG2 as a target for miR129-2, we transfected PDGFB mouse neurospheres with a vector containing the 3′-UTR sequence of NG2 cloned downstream of the firefly luciferase gene (Luc-3′UTR) along with a plasmid vector containing miR129-2. We found that co-expression of Luc-3′UTR and miR129-2 results in significant downregulation of luciferase expression as compared to cells transfected with luc-3′UTR vector alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). Moreover, transient transfection of PDGFB mouse tumor cells with NG2-targeting shRNA or miR129-2 expressing plasmid resulted in downregulation [(76% and 63%, respectively) as compared to control shRNA treated or empty vector treated cells] of NG2 protein as assessed by Western blot assay, validating the role of miR129-2 in regulation of NG2 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>).</p>

        <p>To study the role of NG2 expression in gliomagenesis, we studied mitotically active mouse and human glioma cells. NG2 expression is typically asymmetric in non-malignant dividing stem cells, resulting in only one daughter cell ‘inheriting’ NG2 expression [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

To evaluate the NG2 expression pattern in DIPGs, we expanded human primary DIPG cells as well as neurospheres obtained from PDGFB mouse. Cells were fixed and stained using an antibody against NG2 and monitored for NG2 expression and distribution in dividing cells. Our immunocytochemical assays showed symmetric and equal expression of NG2 in both daughter cells of mouse cells and two human DIPG (SF8628, SUDIPGVI) neurospheres (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>).

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Our study shows NG2 expression to be associated with 78% of our DIPG cohort. This observation is in line with previous measures of NG2 overexpression in a variety of cancers, including melanoma [<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], glioblastoma, and lymphoid leukemia [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, NG2 expression has been shown to correlate with increased glioma malignancy [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. NG2 also binds to collagen VI and laminin 2, and NG2 expressing cells migrate more effectively on collagen and laminin 2 coated surfaces compared to NG2 null cells [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Since collagen VI and laminin 2 are not abundant in brain parenchyma, tumor microvasculature and axonal processes may facilitate migration (and thus infiltration) of NG2 cells. Exploring NG2 and its molecular pathways may provide an opportunity for treating DIPGs by targeting factors that contribute to cellular infiltration.</p>
      <p>Our data suggests the role of miR129-2 in regulating NG2. We show that in DIPGs, significant hypermethylation of miR129-2 promoter results in miR-129-2 downregulation. This correlates with increased NG2 mRNA and protein expression in 71.4% of studied DIPG specimens. Our study shows administration of the demethylating drug 5-Aza results in NG2 downregulation <italic>in vitro</italic>. 5-Aza is a DNA methyl-transferase inhibitor that has been used successfully for targeting miR129-2 in gastric cancer [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and for epigenetic modification of <italic>SOX2</italic> gene in adult malignant glioma cells [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Given our findings that NG2 is highly expressed in a majority of pontine tumors, preclinical studies testing 5-Aza in murine models may be warranted.</p>
      <p>Glial cells of the central nervous system are generally classified into three histologic subtypes: astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. NG2 expressing cells represent the largest number of dividing cells in the adult brain [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The observation that NG2 expressing cells give rise to oligodendrocytes in the developing and mature CNS led to recognition of NG2 expressing cells as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). However, the likelihood of NG2 expressing cells to generate oligodendrocytes or other committed cells is highly debated (reviewed by [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]). Experiments using a tamoxifen-inducible NG2 Cre-ER reporter transgenic mouse model demonstrated anatomic- and age-dependence of NG2 cell differentiation [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These experiments revealed that NG2 cells of postnatal brain develop into oligodendrocytes, whereas NG2 cells in embryonic brain generate a subset of astrocytes in the ventral forebrain in addition to oligodendrocytes. Our observation that NG2 positive cells co-express oligodendrocyte (Olig2) and astrocyte (GFAP) cell markers may suggest their pluripotent potential. However, GFAP expression does not always indicate astrocytic lineage since introduction of the transcription factor NF1A has been shown to induce GFAP expression and astrocytic phenotype in OPC-derived tumors [<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although NG2 expressing cells differentiate into astrocytes or oligodendrocytes depending on age and neuroanatomical location [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], terminal differentiation of these cells may be in disarray in DIPG. This dysregulation of cell differentiation may result in a population of pluripotent tumor progenitor cells leading to a highly infiltrative and lethal cancer. Using human and PDGFB mouse DIPG cells, we demonstrated dichotomous Olig2 and GFAP expression, which may indicate the uncommitted pluripotent state of these cells. However, our results are consistent with others suggesting oligodendrocyte lineage precursors as cells of origin for DIPGs [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p>
      <p>Asymmetric cell division plays an important role in organism development by generating committed progeny while at the same time maintaining a pool of progenitor stem cells to facilitate further development. Recently, NG2 expressing oligodendrocytes, which are glioma tumor progenitors, have been shown to exhibit defective asymmetric cell division [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This abnormal, symmetric cell division results in over-population of oligodendroglial precursor cells with impaired terminal differentiation, leading to neoplasia. Our observation of symmetric division in NG2 expressing mouse tumor neurospheres as well as human DIPG primary cells is consistent with these findings. Further studies are required to assess the expansion of NG2 expressing cells in DIPGs and their role in tumor progression.</p>
      <p>We show that orthotopic injection of (150,000) NG2 expressing mouse cells into pons of P2 mice results in generation of a highly proliferative and infiltrative pontine tumor. More importantly, we demonstrate that this mouse model exhibits a short latency to tumor development (77.8% at three weeks post injection) making it representative of the aggressive clinical course of DIPG, and suitable for rapid testing in preclinical studies. Other published murine models of brainstem tumors have used similar number of cells (100,000-200,000 cells) for intracranial injection [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, the number of injected cells is not contributing to the short latency. Due to its anatomic location and the difficulty in obtaining tissue for molecular study, DIPG is historically an understudied pediatric tumor. The NG2 murine model can be complementary to existing genetically engineered [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and the xenograft [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] models to further characterize DIPG biology and advance towards improved diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, we show that <italic>in vivo</italic> targeting of NG2 by miR129-2 results in downregulation of NG2, providing a strong candidate for targeted therapy for regulating NG2 expression.</p>
