      <abstract>
        <p>Malignant gliomas remain aggressive and lethal primary brain tumors in adults. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently overexpressed in the most common malignant glioma, glioblastoma (GBM), and represents an important therapeutic target. GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) present in tumors are felt to be highly tumorigenic and responsible for tumor recurrence. Multifunctional magnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) can be directly imaged by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and designed to therapeutically target cancer cells. The targeting effects of IONPs conjugated to the EGFR inhibitor, cetuximab (cetuximab-IONPs), were determined with EGFR- and EGFRvIII-expressing human GBM neurospheres and GSCs. Transmission electron microscopy revealed cetuximab-IONP GBM cell binding and internalization. Fluorescence microscopy and Prussian blue staining showed increased uptake of cetuximab-IONPs by EGFR- as well as EGFRvIII-expressing GSCs and neurospheres in comparison to cetuximab or free IONPs. Treatment with cetuximab-IONPs resulted in a significant antitumor effect that was greater than with cetuximab alone due to more efficient, CD133-independent cellular targeting and uptake, EGFR signaling alterations, EGFR internalization, and apoptosis induction in EGFR-expressing GSCs and neurospheres. A significant increase in survival was found after cetuximab-IONP convection-enhanced delivery treatment of 3 intracranial rodent GBM models employing human EGFR-expressing GBM xenografts.</p>

      <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
      <p>Malignant gliomas remain a deadly form of brain cancer with a poor prognosis despite surgery, chemotherapy, and ionizing radiation [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The most common malignant glioma, known as glioblastoma (GBM), is characterized by necrosis, hypoxia, and extensive angiogenesis [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Highly invasive GBM cells are known to infiltrate the surrounding normal brain, making complete resection impossible [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There is a clear need for more effective strategies for the treatment of GBM.</p>
      <p>GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) represent a subpopulation of the tumor which is responsible for tumor initiation, progression, and re-growth after chemoradiation [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], as well as supporting tumor vessel growth and function [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. GSCs are considered a relevant target for therapy of GBM [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Expression of various cell surface markers on GSCs have been reported, including CD133 [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], SSEA1 [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and CD44 [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. CD133-positive populations, isolated from human GBM surgical samples, have been shown to initiate the growth of GBM tumors <italic>in vivo</italic> that recapitulate human tumors [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. CD133-positive human GBM cells secrete a high level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which can contribute to their tumor-initiating capacity [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p>
      <p>The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), including the EGFRvIII deletion mutant, is overexpressed in the majority of GBM tumors and represents a major target for treatment of these tumors [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has shown that the high level of EGFR expression correlates with EGFR gene amplification [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and indicates a poor prognosis in GBM patients [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. EGFR has been used for targeting GSCs previously [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Cetuximab (Erbitux; ImClone Inc.), a 152 kDa chimeric monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G1 subclass that binds to the extracellular domain of the human EGFR [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], has been used to treat GBM [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Targeting of both the wild-type (wt) EGFR and the EGFRvIII deletion mutant is possible with cetuximab [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Cetuximab was found to have an inhibitory effect against GBM cell lines and <italic>in vivo</italic> when systemically administered in xenograft mouse models [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The use of cetuximab for GBM patients has been limited due to its larger size and difficulty crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB) similar to other anti-EGFR antibodies [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Cetuximab has also been evaluated preclinically in a rodent glioma model alone [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], as a delivery agent for methotrexate [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and boron neutron capture therapy after intratumoral convection-enhanced delivery (CED) [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
      <p>Magnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) are becoming an increasingly versatile and potent tool in modern medicine. They can be used for clinical detection by direct magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) due to their strong hypointense T<sub>2</sub> weighted signal (T2WI) [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. They also offer the ability to attach tumor-specific biomolecules to their biocompatible surface for tumor targeting [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>-<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. To reduce nonspecific interactions of IONPs with cells, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating can be used to modify the nanoparticle surface [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. CED is a method for delivering therapeutic agents directly to brain tumors by avoiding the BBB. CED permits distribution of molecules through the brain interstitial spaces by a pressure gradient applied through a catheter implanted in the brain [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Direct delivery into the brain can provide higher concentrations of therapeutic agents in and around brain tumors while minimizing systemic toxic effects.</p>
      <p>The main objective of this study was to investigate the therapeutic targeting effect of cetuximab-IONPs against EGFR- and EGFRvIII-expressing GSCs in addition to GBM tumor non-stem cells. Compared to cetuximab alone, our data support the findings of increased binding by cetuximab-IONPs to EGFR- and EGFRvIII-expressing GBM cells, including GSCs. Greater binding of cetuximab-IONPs and EGFR inhibition results in downstream EGFR cell signaling aberrations. We have also found greater intracellular presence of cetuximab-IONPs and greater translocation of EGFR into the cytoplasm, specifically the cytoskeletal fraction of cells. In combination, greater binding to EGFR, inhibition of EGFR, as well as internalization of the cetuximab-IONPs and EGFR trigger apoptosis in human EGFR-expressing GBM cells including GSCs. The targeted therapy of cetuximab-IONPs with CED <italic>in vivo</italic> revealed a significant therapeutic effect in three different orthotopic mouse models of human GBM.</p>

        <title>EGFR and stem cell markers expression in human GSCs-containing GBM neurospheres</title>
        <p>GBM neurospheres are pathologically relevant models that stably maintain genomic changes of the primary tumor, exhibit stem-like tumor properties, and recapitulate the invasive behavior of GBM [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Early passage neurospheres derived from fresh human surgical specimens of eight GBM patients were analyzed for wtEGFR overexpression or expression of the EGFRvIII deletion mutant. Western blotting confirmed that, relative to normal astrocytes, all neurosphere cultures express higher levels of wtEGFR and that these levels varied in the neurosphere set: N08-30 displayed strong, N08-74, N08-1002, N09-30, N09-33, N09-20 and N09-21 intermediate, and N09-32 weak EGFR expression. Only the N08-30 neurospheres were positive for both wtEGFR and the EGFRvIII mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>, top). The ability of GBM neurospheres to maintain wtEGFR expression after <italic>in vitro</italic> passaging was confirmed by higher expression of wtEGFR in GBM neurospheres compared to normal human astrocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>, bottom) and neural human progenitor cells (NHPC) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). In all other experiments, however, neurospheres in early passage were used. Neurospheres N08-74, N08-1002, N08-30, N09-30, N09-32, and N09-33 were positive for the stem cell marker CD133, N08-30 and N09-32 displaying very strong expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>). All neurospheres were positive for stem cell markers nestin, Nanog, and Sox-2, except for N08-21, which was positive only for nestin and Nanog. N09-20 had a low level of Sox2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S1D</xref>). Expression of the stem cell marker CD133 in GBM neurospheres was further characterized by Flow cytometry (FACS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>).</p>
        <p>For further studies, we chose the EGFRvIII/wtEGFR-positive N08-30 and the wtEGFR-positive N08-74 and N08-1002 neurospheres.</p>

        <p>N08-74, N08-30, and N08-1002 neurospheres formed invasive tumors in athymic nude mice brains within 4-11 months after implantation as confirmed by MRI and histological examination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>). All neurospheres tested showed multi-lineage differentiation. When grown in neurobasal medium supplemented with 10% FCS, neurospheres became positive for glial (GFAP) and neuronal (Tuj 1) differentiation markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2C</xref>). At the same time, no or significantly decreased expression of the neuronal marker Olig 2 and the stem cell marker CD133 was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S2D</xref>).</p>

        <title>Preparation, physicochemical characterization of bioconjugated IONPs, and their cellular uptake</title>
        <p>A schematic diagram of cetuximab-IONPs is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, left. Covalent antibody conjugation to amphiphilic triblock copolymer-coated IONPs (PEG MW 2000) [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] (kit by Ocean Nanotech Inc., Little Rock, AK) was confirmed by mobility shift in agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, right). Briefly, for antibody conjugation, activation of the carboxyl groups on the IONPs was performed in an activation buffer containing ethyl dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide (EDC) and NHS (sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide). Conjugation of IONPs to amino groups of cetuximab, human IgG, and EGFRvIII antibodies was carried out at an approximate 1: 1 (IONPs: antibody) molar ratio. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis revealed that the mean diameters of the cetuximab-IONPs, EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs, and free IONPs were 19, 21, and 11 nm, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, top). The zeta potentials of the cetuximab-IONPs, EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs, and free IONPs were −21.5±1.07, −26.2±1.31, and −26.0±0.53 mV, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, bottom). To evaluate the cellular uptake of the cetuximab-IONPs, we performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Prussian blue staining after treatment of cells. TEM revealed uptake of cetuximab-IONPs by GBM neurospheres N08-74 and N08-1002. Nanoparticles were found freely within the cytosol and in endosomes, suggesting endocytosis of the cetuximab-IONPs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, top). To assess the targeting effect by cell binding, we compared Prussian blue staining of GBM neurospheres N08-30 incubated with IONPs and cetuximab-IONPs for 24 hs. Data in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, bottom confirm the highest uptake of cetuximab-IONPs, suggesting improved internalization of cetuximab-IONPs compared to IONPs. Markedly decreased phosphorylation of Y1068, one of the major autophosphorylation sites on EGFR, in cetuximab-IONP-treated N08-30 and N08-1002 neurospheres (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) confirm the biological activity of cetuximab-IONPs on EGFR signaling in GBM neurospheres.</p>

        <title>Cytotoxic effect of cetuximab-IONPs in human GBM neurospheres <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
        <p>Cetuximab was previously reported to elicit significant cytotoxicity and increased apoptosis in GBM cell lines with EGFR amplification [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We tested the effect of cetuximab-IONPs on the growth of GBM neurospheres with varying levels of EGFR expression. Neurospheres N08-74, N08-30, and N08-1002 were incubated with free IONPs (0.2 mg/ml), cetuximab-IONPs (0.2 mg/ml), and cetuximab (50 μg/ml) alone for 24, 48, and 72 hs (50 μg/ml cetuximab was used since in the conjugation reaction we used 1: 1 molar ratio, equivalent to 4 μg IONPs: 1 μg cetuximab). Cells from adult normal human brain (NB) were used as a control. A cell proliferation and viability assay was performed after each time point. In this assay, the absorbance of control (untreated neurospheres) cells is considered as 100% of live cells and the absorbance of treated cells is proportionate to that of the control cells. Absorbance was corrected by subtracting the background (IONPs in media, or media only, respectively). Cetuximab-IONPs significantly decreased cell survival in all neurospheres tested, most prominently after 72 h treatment <italic>(P</italic>&lt;0.001<italic>)</italic> whereas cetuximab alone had a modest effect on neurosphere cell viability. Due to nonspecific uptake, free IONPs also compromised cell survival in N08-74 neurospheres, but much less efficiently than cetuximab-IONPs. None of the treatments was toxic to human astrocytes (data not shown) and NB cells after 72 hs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In contrast to hIgG-IONPs, cetuximab-IONPs decreased viability of N08-30 GBM neurospheres (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) and in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). These results confirm that the conjugation of cetuximab to IONPs is crucial for enhanced cytotoxicity of cetuximab-IONPs against all GBM neurospheres. As an additional control, we used the GBM cell line U87MGwtEGFR (overexpressing wtEGFR). Treatment with hIgG-IONPs, cetuximab-IONPs, control vehicle, or cetuximab for 144 hs resulted in significantly decreased survival only in cells treated with cetuximab-IONPs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In the parental cell line U87MG with low basal wtEGFR expression, the cytotoxic effect of cetuximab-IONPs was about 6x lower than in U87MGwtEGFR (data not shown). Together, these results indicate a significant and selective EGFR-dependent cytotoxic effect of cetuximab-IONPs on the growth of GBM neurospheres and cell lines and no toxicity with normal brain cells.</p>

A significant decrease in cell survival was found in U87MGwtEGFR GBM cell treated with the cetuximab-IONPs (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001).

        <title>Cetuximab-IONPs induce apoptosis and wtEGFR internalization in human GBM neurospheres</title>
        <p>Next, we examined the mechanism of cytotoxicity of the cetuximab-IONPs to GBM neurospheres, focusing on apoptosis and autophagy as putative mechanisms of cell death. In human GBM neurospheres N08-74, N08-30, and N08-1002, none of the treatments induced conversion of LC3B-I to LCB3-II, the hallmark of autophagy (data not shown), suggesting that autophagy is not a likely mode of cell death. In contrast, treatment with cetuximab-IONPs resulted in elevated levels of cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved PARP in GBM neurospheres N08-74, without any cleavage observed in cells treated with free IONPs and cetuximab for 3 hs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, left). After a 14 h incubation, induction of caspase 3 cleavage was even more pronounced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, right). In neurospheres N08-30, treatment with cetuximab-IONPs also resulted in elevated levels of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 3. Free IONPs also increased caspase 3 cleavage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, left), most likely due to nonspecific uptake as evidenced in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, bottom. On the other hand, in neurospheres N08-1002, both cetuximab-IONPs and cetuximab alone caused apoptosis through cleavage of PARP and caspase 3. Cetuximab-IONPs and cetuximab alone inhibited phosphorylation of Y1068 in EGFR in N08-74 (data not shown). A concomitant decrease in phospho-ERK44/42 levels was also observed in the presence/absence of EGF and FGF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, top) (cetuximab has up to 10-fold higher affinity for EGFR than the EGF and can thus competitively inhibit EGF binding to the receptor [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]). When comparing GBM neurospheres N08-1002 and NHPC, elevated PARP cleavage was observed only in neurospheres treated with cetuximab-IONPs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, bottom). Consistently, U0126 (inhibitor of the ERK pathway) also increased PARP cleavage in cetuximab-IONP-treated cells (data not shown). By subcellular protein fractionation we found that treatment with cetuximab-IONPs for 2 (data not shown) and 5 hs promoted translocation of wtEGFR to the cytoplasmic (data not shown) and predominantly to the cytoskeletal fraction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, 60-fold increase over control as indicated by densitometric analysis). Compared with control, cetuximab-IONP treatment induced increased translocation of wtEGFR to the lysosomes (data not shown), suggesting increased lysosomal degradation of EGFR in the presence cetuximab-IONPs. In U87MG cells, cetuximab-IONP treatment resulted in elevated levels of cleaved caspase 3 only in U87MGwtEGFR cells but not in the parental U87MG cell line with basal level of wtEGFR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). These data highlight the necessity of EGFR for biological activity of the cetuximab-IONPs.</p>
        <p>In summary, these data demonstrate that cetuximab-IONPs specifically induce increased apoptosis in GBM neurospheres and cell lines in comparison to NHPC, and promote traslocation of wtEGFR predominantly to the cytoskeletal fraction within cells.</p>

Neurospheres were treated with free IONPs (0.2 mg/ml), cetuximab-IONPs (0.2 mg/ml), control vehicle, or cetuximab alone (50 μg/ml) and expression of apoptotic proteins was evaluated by Western blotting. Elevated levels of cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved PARP were found in neurospheres N08-74 and N08-30 after treatment with cetuximab-IONPs for 3 (A, left) and in neurospheres N08-74 for 14 hs (A, right). Treatment with cetuximab-IONPs was most effective in inducing cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP although some caspase 3 cleavage was also induced by free IONPs in N08-30. In neurospheres N08-1002, induction of caspase 3 and PARP cleavage, and decreased phosphorylation of ERK 44/42 was found after 3 h treatment with cetuximab-IONPs and cetuximab alone, both in the presence and absence of EGF and FGF, caspase 3 was used as a control (B, top). Treatment with cetuximab-IONPs (but not the control conjugated antibody) increased cleavage of PARP in neurospheres N08-1002 whereas no cleavage was observed in NHPC (B, bottom). (C) N08-30 neurospheres were treated as above for 5 hs, lysates were subcellularly fractionated, and analyzed by Western blotting. Elevated levels of wtEGFR were found in the cytoskeletal fraction after cells were treated with cetuximab-IONPs. (D) U87MG and U87MGwtEGFR human GBM cell lines were treated with free IONPs, cetuximab-IONPs, or cetuximab alone. Apoptosis, as indicated by activation of caspase 3 cleavage, was seen only in the U87MGwtEGFR cell line treated with cetuximab-IONPs.</p>

        <p>We also investigated the effect of cetuximab-IONPs on the growth of human GSCs. GSCs and GBM CD133-negative cells from N08-74, N08-30 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), and N08-1002 neurospheres with varying levels of EGFR expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), were treated with free IONPs, cetuximab-IONPs, and cetuximab for 24, 48, and 72 hs. CD133 positivity of GSCs on the day of the experiment was verified by Western blot (data not shown). Cell proliferation and survival assays revealed that cetuximab-IONPs most efficiently decreased survival of GSCs and GBM CD133-negative cells (except N08-1002) after 72 hs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, B</xref>) (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001).

        <title>Cetuximab-IONPs induce apoptosis in human GSCs and tumor non-stem cells</title>
        <p>Apoptosis and cleavage of caspase 3 was investigated as a mechanism of cell death in GSCs and GBM CD133-negative cells. Both populations from the neurospheres N08-74 and N08-30 were incubated with free IONPs, cetuximab-IONPs, and cetuximab alone. Cetuximab-IONPs induced apoptosis in N08-74 GSCs and GBM CD133-negative cells, as indicated by the presence of cleaved PARP and caspase 3 after treatment for 3 hs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>) and cleaved PARP after 6, 8, and 24 hs (data not shown). We did not find any increase in cleaved caspase 3 or PARP after treatment with free IONPs and cetuximab alone. Only cetuximab-IONP-treated N08-30 GSCs underwent apoptosis, as shown by cleaved PARP and caspase 3, whereas cetuximab alone had less of an effect. In CD133-negative GBM cells from N08-30, the opposite was observed: cetuximab alone was more potent than cetuximab-IONPs in inducing cleavage of PARP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Drug-treated cancer cells can undergo apoptosis due to activation of intrinsic or extrinsic pathways. We found increased cleavage of caspase 9, a hallmark of activation of intrinsic apoptosis, in N08-30 GSCs and GBM CD133-negative cells treated with cetuximab-IONPs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Treatment with cetuximab-IONPs and cetuximab alone for 30 min, 1, and 3 hs inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR Y1068 in N08-74 GSCs (data not shown). In addition, significant inhibition of ERK44/42 phosphorylation was observed in N08-74 GSCs, along with a more modest effect in GBM CD133-negative cells treated for 3 hs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). Treatment with cetuximab-IONPs for 72 hs showed more significant inhibition of ERK44/42 phosphorylation than treatment with cetuximab alone in N08-74 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>) and N08-30 (data not shown) GSCs. Furthermore, treatment with cetuximab-IONPs and to a lesser extent cetuximab alone dramatically decreased expression of the stem cell marker CD133 in N08-30 GSCs (data not shown) and stem cell markers CD133 and Sox2 in N08-74 GSCs after 3 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Similarly as in GBM neurospheres, subcellular protein fractionation revealed that treatment of GSCs with cetuximab-IONPs for 5 hs promoted translocation of the wtEGFR predominantly to the cytoskeletal fraction (data not shown).</p>
        <p>Use of IONPs conjugated to an EGFRvIII antibody (EGFRvIIIAb-IONPs), but not the EGFRvIIIAb alone, induced apoptosis through cleavage of caspase 3 in GSCs and GBM CD133-negative cells from N08-74 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). These results further support the finding that targeting wtEGFR and the EGFRvIII mutant by EGFR-antibody conjugated IONPs triggers cell death via apoptosis in human GSCs.</p>

Human GBM xenograft tumors were established in athymic nude mice with the human GSC-containing neurospheres N08-30, the human GBM U87MGwtEGFR cell line that overexpresses wtEGFR and the CD133 stem cell marker [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and the GBM LN229wtEGFR cell line that also overexpresses wtEGFR [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Athymic nude mice intracranially implanted with N08-30 neurospheres (7 animals per group) and U87MGwtEGFR cells (10 animals per group) were divided into 4 CED treatment groups: cetuximab-IONPs (5μg), free IONPs (5μg,) free cetuximab (5μg), and a control group (HBSS). Mice implanted with LN229wtEGFR (7 animals per group) were divided into 3 CED treatment groups: cetuximab-IONPs (5μg), free cetuximab (5μg), and a control group (HBSS).

        <p>In mice implanted with the GSC-containing neurospheres, MRI was performed prior to CED to monitor tumor growth and initiation of CED treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Tumor xenografts derived from the implanted GSC-containing neurospheres had imaging and pathologic characteristics of infiltrating and invasive GBM tumors. After CED of cetuximab-IONPs (day 41 after tumor implantation), MRI on day 0 confirmed T<sub>2</sub>-weighted signal drop and distribution of the cetuximab-IONPs (in the brain 4.79 mm<sup>3</sup> cetuximab-IONPs is distributed over 1.36 mm<sup>3</sup> of tumor), T<sub>2</sub>-weighted signal drop correlated with intra- and peri-tumoral cetuximab-IONP distribution (black arrows) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, top and bottom, upper panel). The nanoparticles were still visible on day 146 post CED, revealing delayed clearance of the nanoparticles from the mouse brain. Intracranial xenograft tumors were confirmed by histopathology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5A</xref>, left). Prussian blue staining also confirmed intra- and peri-tumoral presence of nanoparticles in the human neurosphere xenografts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5A</xref>, right). Immunostaining with wtEGFR and EGFRvIII antibodies confirmed wtEGFR and EGFRvIII expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S5B</xref>, left and right).

        <p>Additionally, we monitored targeting and the presence of nanoparticles in human GBM xenografts by MRI (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>).

We confirmed dramatic T<sub>2</sub>-weighted signal drop within the xenograft tumor (white arrows) and distribution of cetuximab-IONPs on day 0 after CED. T<sub>2</sub> signal drop increased on days 16, 30, and 44 confirming dispersion of the bioconjugated IONPs into the surrounding brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>, left, black arrow). On day 49 post tumor implantation (44 post CED), MRI of control mice revealed large tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>, right, lower panel), whereas significantly smaller tumors were detected in cetuximab-IONP-treated mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>, right, upper panel). Histopathology confirmed the presence of intracranial xenograft tumors that expressed wtEGFR and in intracranial xenografts from mice treated with the cetuximab-IONPs significantly higher caspase 3 cleavage was detected (data not shown).</p>
        <p>Most importantly, in the LN229wtEGFR model, the median survival time of mice treated with cetuximab-IONPs was 73 days, two and half time longer than control mice and mice that underwent CED with cetuximab only with median survival times of 29 and 30 days, repectively (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.005) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref>).

      <title>DISCUSSION</title>
      <p>Unsatisfactory results of standard GBM therapy have resulted in multiple efforts to search for new therapeutic strategies. Proper delivery of therapeutic agents and tumor targeting are important goals that will help overcome obstacles in the treatment of primary malignant brain tumors. GBM tumors which rarely metastasize, and are locally invasive in the brain, represent a potential target for loco-regional delivery strategies, such as CED [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. CED was developed as a tool for intracerebral drug delivery and its utility has been demonstrated in multiple human clinical trials [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. CED provides high local concentration of drugs in the brain with relatively uniform distribution permitting subsequent diffusion and further dispersion of drugs into the surrounding brain. The other advantage of CED is the ability to concentrate therapeutic agents into the tumor and surrounding brain tissue and avoid systemic toxicities [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>
      <p>The importance of EGFR in the malignant progression of GBM and the effect of EGFR on patient survival has been extensively documented. Heterogeneity of GBM tumors with respect to <italic>in situ EGFR</italic> amplification was previously reported in tumor cells with <italic>EGFR</italic> amplification enriched at the invading margin of tumors [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. EGFR has been proposed as a prospective GSC marker [<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and targeting of EGFR by small molecules or antibodies is therapeutically relevant [<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The CD133 marker allows identification of a clinically more aggressive molecular subtype of GBM and is associated with a worse outcome [<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Newer studies provide evidence that CD133 negative cells can also be tumorigenic in a rodent model, albeit less efficiently as CD133-positive GSCs [<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p>
      <p>IONPs represent a multifunctional clinical platform that can be designed to therapeutically target cancer cells while simultaneously be sensitively imaged by MRI. There have been several attempts to use magnetic nanoparticles to target GBM [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. IONPs conjugated with RGD have been used for noninvasive monitoring and orthotopic GBM therapy [<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Other groups studied the effect of curcumin-conjugated nanoparticles on GSCs <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The effect of TRAIL conjugated to nanoparticles in GBM models <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> has also been explored [<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. We have previously described the conjugation of a purified EGFRvIII antibody to amphiphilic triblock copolymer-coated IONPs for the imaging and treatment of GBM [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this study, we are the first to report that IONPs bioconjugated to the chimeric monoclonal EGFR antibody, cetuximab, have a much greater therapeutic effect against GBM than cetuximab alone. In side-by-side comparisons, cetuximab-IONPs were more effective than cetuximab alone and offered significantly increased tumor cell toxicity <italic>in vitro</italic> against human GBM neurospheres, GSCs, and GBM CD133-negative cells expressing various levels of wtEGFR. The significant <italic>in vitro</italic> effect was also observed in human GBM neurospheres, GSCs, and CD133-negative tumor cells which also expressed the EGFRvIII deletion mutant.</p>
      <p>Potential mechanisms responsible for the cytotoxic effect of cetuximab-IONPs against different types of GBM cells include increased apoptosis through activation of the intrinsic pathway resulting in elevated cleaved caspase 3 levels. We have also found EGFR signaling alterations, as indicated by significant inhibition of ERK44/42 phosphorylation in GSCs treated with cetuximab-IONPs. We have determined the cetuximab-IONPs bind to both the wtEGFR and the EGFRvIII deletion mutant, are internalized by the tumor cells, and that conjugation with IONPs enhances internalization. We believe when internalized, cetuximab-IONPs accumulate and a pro-apoptotic signal is triggered, as the consequence of EGFR signaling dysregulation, through cleavage of caspase 9, followed by cleavage of caspase 3 that eventually causes cancer cell death. Although the pro-apoptotic effect of EGFR-targeting therapies has been described previously, cetuximab elicited a pro-apoptotic effect only in GBM cell lines with <italic>EGFR</italic> amplification [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Moreover, in a subcellular fractionation experiment, we were able to show transport of EGFR to the cytoplasm, predominantly to the cytoskeletal fraction. This suggests increased endocytosis and degradation of EGFR in cells treated with cetuximab-IONPs.</p>
      <p>Our data suggest that cetuximab conjugation to IONPs amplifies the biological effect of cetuximab and cetuximab-IONPs are effective against GBM cells with varying levels of EGFR expression. Cetuximab in the cetuximab-IONPs complex performs a dual function: by targeting EGFR, it not only inhibits the EGFR signaling pathway but also facilitates attachment of the IONPs onto the GBM cell surface. The reason for the higher cytotoxicity of cetuximab-IONPs may be greater uptake, compared to free IONPs and cetuximab alone, by GBM cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. This results in a higher concentration of intracellular IONPs that eventually trigger apoptosis [<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we have found that treatment of GSCs with cetuximab-IONPs dramatically decreases the expression of the GSC markers CD133 and Sox2, providing further support for targeting of GSCs.</p>
      <p>The data presented do show that cetuximab-IONPs have a significant therapeutic effect with 3 different GBM animal models. Cetuximab-IONP CED permitted direct imaging by MRI, revealing intra- and peritumoral localization of the nanoparticles in three orthotopic intracranial rodent GBM models. One of these models is characterized by invasive xenografts grown from patient-derived GSC-containing neurospheres and the two other models with xenografts derived from human GBM cell lines. No evidence of toxicity or inflammation was found in rodents treated by the cetuximab-IONPs. In our previous study, we reported on MRI-guided CED of cetuximab-IONPs and demonstrated its safety and feasibility in healthy canine patients [<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Present studies involved both mice with xenografts as well as healthy immunocompetent mice. Widespread distribution of the nanoparticles within and adjacent to xenograft tumors was observed in all three models as evidenced by MRI and histopathology. This suggests that cetuximab-IONPs can potentially target the main tumor mass and infiltrating cancer cells residing away from the tumor mass. The survival of athymic nude mice implanted with GBM xenografts was significantly prolonged after CED with the cetuximab-IONPs in all three models.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have determined that cetuximab-IONPs bind to both the wtEGFR and the EGFRvIII deletion mutant on human patient-derived GBM cells (including GSCs), inhibit EGFR cell signaling, are internalized by the tumor cells, and promote internalization of the EGFR resulting in enhanced apoptosis. Treatment with cetuximab-IONPs exerted a significant therapeutic effect <italic>in vivo</italic> in 3 different orthotopic GBM mouse models after CED. One of the rodent models developed invasive intracranial human GSC xenografts from a patient with GBM. Cetuximab-IONPs are safe, can be visualized on standard T<sub>2</sub> weighted MRI, are retained in brain tumors for many weeks with no evidence of toxicity to the surrounding brain. No toxicity to healthy immunocompetent mice was observed after CED of cetuximab-IONPs. We have thus provided a proof of principle that GSCs and GBM tumors can be targeted with cetuximab-conjugated IONPs and established the basis for a future human clinical trial for patients with GBM.</p>
