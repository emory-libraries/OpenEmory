      <abstract>
        <p>The Nicotine Metabolite Ratio (NMR, ratio of <italic>trans</italic>-3’-hydroxycotinine and cotinine), has previously been associated with CYP2A6 activity, response to smoking cessation treatments, and cigarette consumption. We searched for drug metabolizing enzyme and transporter (DMET) gene variation associated with the NMR and prospective abstinence in 2,946 participants of laboratory studies of nicotine metabolism and of clinical trials of smoking cessation therapies. Stage I was a meta-analysis of the association of 507 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 173 DMET genes with the NMR in 449 participants of two laboratory studies. Nominally significant associations were identified in ten genes after adjustment for intragenic SNPs; <italic>CYP2A6</italic> and two <italic>CYP2A6</italic> SNPs attained experiment-wide significance adjusted for correlated SNPs (<italic>CYP2A6 P</italic><sub>ACT</sub>=4.1E-7, rs4803381 <italic>P</italic><sub>ACT</sub>=4.5E-5, rs1137115, <italic>P</italic><sub>ACT</sub>=1.2E-3). Stage II was mega-regression analyses of 10 DMET SNPs with pretreatment NMR and prospective abstinence in up to 2,497 participants from eight trials. rs4803381 and rs1137115 SNPs were associated with pretreatment NMR at genome-wide significance. In <italic>post-hoc</italic> analyses of <italic>CYP2A6</italic> SNPs, we observed nominally significant association with: abstinence in one pharmacotherapy arm; cigarette consumption among all trial participants; and lung cancer in four case:control studies. <italic>CYP2A6</italic> minor alleles were associated with reduced NMR, CPD, and lung cancer risk. We confirmed the major role that CYP2A6 plays in nicotine metabolism, and made novel findings with respect to genome-wide significance and associations with CPD, abstinence and lung cancer risk. Additional multivariate analyses with patient variables and genetic modeling will improve prediction of nicotine metabolism, disease risk and smoking cessation treatment prognosis.</p>

Stage I data can be found here: dbGaP Study ID phs000931.v1.p1 Stage II genotype and phenotype data cannot be provided to dbGaP from five of the eight RCTs. Two RCTs are from the 1990s and informed written consent was not obtained for individual level data sharing, and three RCTs do not have permission from their Institutional Review Board to share data other than the data already provided to dbGaP and to the Pharmacogenetics of Nicotine Addiction Treatment Consortium. Therefore I will not submit individual level data from Stage II of this analysis to dbGaP as the remaining data from Stage II (10 SNPs in three RCTs) would be an incomplete dataset (representing 0% of the RCT data with baseline NMR, and 32% of the RCT data with baseline nicotine dependence and prospective abstinence measures). Readers may contact Andrew W Bergen PhD to request data from the three remaining RCTs.</meta-value>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The predominant enzyme involved in nicotine and cotinine metabolism is CYP2A6 [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126113.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], where nicotine is metabolized primarily to cotinine, and cotinine primarily to <italic>trans</italic>-3’-hydroxycotinine. The Nicotine Metabolite Ratio (NMR) is the ratio of the metabolites <italic>trans</italic>-3’-hydroxycotinine and cotinine. The ratio reflects the enzymatic activity of CYP2A6 and is a biomarker of the rate of nicotine clearance [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The ratio is associated with smoking topography [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], responsiveness to smoking cessation treatments [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and the number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD) [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Significant correlations between the NMR and a) oral clearance of nicotine, b) oral clearance and <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of cotinine, and c) lack of production of <italic>trans</italic>-3’-hydroxycotinine in individuals homozygous for null <italic>CYP2A6</italic> alleles, support the validity of the NMR as a marker of CYP2A6 activity [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition to <italic>CYP2A6</italic>, genetic and biochemical studies have identified contributions of additional DMET loci to measures of nicotine metabolism in diverse samples and study designs. Gene variants associated with differences in nicotine metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] influence smoking behavior, tobacco exposures and attributable disease risks, and could serve as biomarkers for disease risk, and treatment prognosis [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p>
      <p>To discover and develop novel biomarkers of nicotine metabolism and related phenotypes, we performed a planned analysis to: a) identify DMET SNPs associated with the laboratory study-based NMR [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126113.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] using the DMET Plus Array [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; b) validate nominally significant DMET SNP associations with baseline NMR in clinical trial participants from two trials [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; and, c) further validate nominally significant DMET SNPs with end-of-treatment and six-month seven day point prevalence abstinence (abstinence) in clinical trial participants from eight trials [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We also conducted <italic>post-hoc</italic> analyses of validated DMET SNPs in clinical trial participants with abstinence by smoking cessation pharmacotherapy assignment, and with nicotine dependence measures among all participants. Finally, we interrogated a meta-GWAS lung cancer database [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] for association results of two validated DMET SNPs.</p>

        <title>Stage I Participants</title>
        <p>Stage I participants were derived from two distinct studies (<xref rid="pone.0126113.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Healthy twin pairs and siblings were recruited from the Northern California Twin Registry, age ≥18 and &lt;65 years, &lt;130% of height-adjusted ideal weight, neither pregnant nor intending to become pregnant, and after exclusion of chronic medical and psychiatric conditions (PKTWIN study) [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Participants underwent a 30 minute infusion of deuterium-labeled nicotine (3’,3’-dideuteronicotine) and cotinine (2’,4’,5’,6’-tetradeuterocotinine), monitoring, and blood and urine collection in a hospital setting [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Probands and two first-degree relatives from 158 pedigrees with ≥three ever-smoking individuals per pedigree were recruited to assess the relations between genetic factors, environmental factors and tobacco use (SMOFAM study) [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Individuals from 61 pedigrees completed a clinical study of nicotine metabolism; oral administration of a fixed dose of deuterium-labeled nicotine and cotinine at home, monitored by a nurse, was followed by collection, aliquoting and freezing of saliva samples at multiple time points [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Participants completed a detailed questionnaire and provided a blood sample for DNA extraction and analysis [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Levels of nicotine, cotinine <italic>trans</italic>-3’-hydroxycotinine and their glucuronides were estimated via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and pharmacokinetic phenotypes calculated, as described [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], from each study.</p>

Genotype and phenotype data are accessible through application to a data access committee using dbGaP Study ID phs000931.v1.p1. We performed association analyses with common biallelic SNPs and indels [≥0.05 minor allele frequency (MAF) in each dataset] with the NMR derived from the six hour biospecimen collection. In the PKTWIN dataset, the NMR was square-root transformed and adjusted for age, age-squared, BMI, sex, smoking status (current versus other), and any hormone use (menopausal status and/or reproductive hormone use versus no hormone use). In the SMOFAM dataset, the NMR was log transformed and adjusted for age, aged-squared, BMI, sex, and smoking status. We constructed principal components of population genetic variation using 655 unlinked (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>&lt;0.5) DMET Plus Array SNPs in 323 PKTWIN individuals and 212 SMOFAM individuals, and used the first ten principal components to further adjust the NMR in each dataset. To avoid heterogeneity due to potential differential linkage disequilibrium among different continental population samples, genotype-phenotype analyses presented were performed on individuals who self-identified as White. Additive models were evaluated for each common SNP via Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] as our primary analysis (<xref rid="pone.0126113.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).

<italic>p</italic>-values&lt;0.05 and evaluated availability of TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays (Life Technologies). Of 16 selected SNPs, 12 SNPs had predesigned assays, two were proxy SNPs (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 1, Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe HapMap sample, CEU) with predesigned assays, and two had custom assays designed (<xref rid="pone.0126113.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0126113.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). We performed genotyping on the TaqMan OpenArray SNP Genotyping System or ViiA 7 using laboratory study, clinical trial, and HapMap (Coriell Cell Repositories, Camden, NJ) DNA samples. Stage II SNP genotyping assays were evaluated for clustering, concordance and completion rates prior to removing DNA samples with low completion rates, then for concordance, completion and Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). Quality control procedures and summary results are described in <xref rid="pone.0126113.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>, and completion rate and HWE significance by assay and by clinical trial are described in <xref rid="pone.0126113.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0126113.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref> Tables. Six of 16 selected DMET SNPs failed genotype clustering, completion rate and HWE quality thresholds. Thus, ten SNPs from seven of 10 genes passed quality thresholds and were included in subsequent analyses. In the course of evaluating the specificity of custom assays for one <italic>CYP2A6</italic> SNP (rs4803381), we resolved an ambiguous genomic location, i.e., evidence for rs4803381’s location proximal to <italic>CYP2A6</italic> rather than proximal to <italic>CYP2A7</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0126113.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).</p>
        <p>We used linear regression to estimate association of ten DMET SNPs on natural log transformed NMR in treatment-seeking smokers from two trials [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], adjusted for age, age-squared, BMI, sex, the first three principal components of population genetic variation obtained from analysis of 45 ancestry informative markers [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and site. We used logistic regression to estimate association between ten DMET SNPs on end of treatment and on six month abstinence in treatment-seeking smokers from eight trials [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], adjusting for age, age-squared, BMI, sex, education (college degree or less than a college degree), marital status (married or other), principal components, and 26 treatment arms. For both analyses, we imputed missing values for BMI (N = 43), education (N = 10) and marital status (N = 7) 20 times, analyses were performed on each data set, and results combined with adjustment to reflect the variance attributable to the imputations [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p>

        <p>For two <italic>CYP2A6</italic> SNPs (rs4803381 and rs1137115) we estimated the proportions of variance and significance of association with: cigarettes per day (CPD), coded as a continuous variable and as in the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] or Cigarette Dependence (FTCD) [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]; time to first cigarette after waking (TTFC); and total FTND/FTCD score. Model covariates in nicotine dependence regressions were age, age squared, BMI, sex, education, marital status, three principal components of population genetic variation, and site. We performed regression analyses to evaluate the influence of rs4803381 on prospective abstinence outcomes stratified by pharmacotherapy. Model covariates in abstinence regressions were the same as in the nicotine dependence regressions with the addition of clinical trial arm. Power analyses of SNP associations with NMR and six month prospective abstinence were performed. The TRICL meta-GWAS database, comprised of multiple case:control studies of lung cancer [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], was interrogated for existing association results at two <italic>CYP2A6</italic> SNPs.</p>

Five SMOFAM individuals were excluded from analysis, one with a NMR value more than five standard deviates above the mean, and four due to genotypes inconsistent with interview-based family relationships. We excluded 121 and 28 DMET SNPs in PKTWIN and SMOFAM, respectively, from analysis due to nominally significant deviation (<italic>p</italic>-values&lt;0.05) from HWE. We tested 608 DMET SNPs common in PKTWIN and 531 SNPs common in SMOFAM, and adjusted for multiple tests in genes with more than one SNP tested using the P<sub>ACT</sub> procedure. We meta-analyzed 507 SNPs within 173 genes in 449 individuals from the PKTWIN and SMOFAM datasets and adjusted for multiple SNPs within a gene, and for two datasets, using the meta-<italic>P</italic><sub>ACT</sub> procedure. <xref rid="pone.0126113.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>–<xref rid="pone.0126113.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref> Tables contain genotype counts and HLM analyses results, meta-analysis Z scores and <italic>p</italic>-values, and meta-<italic>P</italic><sub>ACT</sub> gene-wise <italic>p</italic>-values, respectively.

        <p>In analyses of end-of-treatment and six month abstinence among individuals randomized to one of six (end-of-treatment) and to one of nine (six months) different pharmacotherapies, we observed two results of interest (<xref rid="pone.0126113.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Table</xref>). In the first result of interest, we observed increased abstinence in individuals randomized to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) (<xref rid="pone.0126113.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Table</xref>). After analyses by mode of administration, we observed increased abstinence at end-of-treatment and at six months, with a trend towards significance (<italic>p</italic>-values &lt; .10) in individuals randomized to NRT patch [in 339 individuals, OR<sub>end-of-treatment</sub> (95%CI) <italic>P</italic> = 1.348 (0.961–1.890) 0.084 and OR<sub>six months</sub> (95%CI) <italic>P</italic> = 1.386 (0.973–1.975) 0.071]. These observations, while not statistically significant, are the most directly interpretable. We also observed a nominally statistically significant rs4803381 association with six month abstinence in one arm of 66 individuals first treated with combined NRT and bupropion from baseline to 12 weeks and then randomized to chronic bupropion (<italic>P</italic> = 0.023). This result has a more speculative interpretation.</p>
        <p>rs1137115 was nominally significantly associated with lung cancer in a meta-analysis of four studies from the TRICL database [fixed effects odds ratio (95%CI) <italic>P</italic> 0.92 (0.87–0.97) 0.0022], and in two of the individual case:control studies (<xref rid="pone.0126113.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Table</xref>). rs4803381 does not have results in the TRICL database. The direction of effect of the rs1137115 association with lung cancer is consistent with the reduced nicotine metabolism and cigarette consumption associated with the rs1137115 minor allele we observed in our Stage I and II analyses, and with the functional effects of rs1137115 evaluated in <italic>ex vivo</italic> hepatic tissue [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126113.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p>

In the <italic>post-hoc</italic> meta-analysis of four case:control studies, rs1137115 was associated with lung cancer at nominal significance.

        <p>Our multivariate analysis of two <italic>CYP2A6</italic> SNPs, demographics, population genetic variation and clinical trial site accounted for up to 22.2% of the variance of the pretreatment NMR with the individual SNPs accounting for approximately half of this variance. Validation of the association of <italic>CYP2A6</italic> SNPs with the NMR confirms the role CYP2A6 plays in nicotine metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126113.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126113.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Both SNPs are common polymorphisms in continental ancestry samples, where the rs4803381 European ancestry minor allele is the major allele in Asian and African HapMap populations. The minor alleles of rs4803381 and rs1137115 are associated with reduced <italic>CYP2A6</italic> transcript levels [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126113.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], CYP2A6 protein level [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and CYP2A6 activity [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126113.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and are linked with reduced function <italic>CYP2A6</italic> alleles [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] (<xref rid="pone.0126113.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>).</p>
        <p>rs4803381 and rs1137155 were significantly associated with cigarette consumption coded continuously or as in the FTND/FTCD (<xref rid="pone.0126113.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The influence of a single allele of rs4803381 and of rs1137115 in our multivariate regressions of treatment-seeking smokers were -0.11 and -0.098 standard deviates of continuously coded CPD, or a reduction of 0.99 and 0.88 cigarette per day (unadjusted means in <xref rid="pone.0126113.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Table</xref>), which represent effect sizes larger than those associated with other <italic>CYP2A6</italic> SNPs, e.g., rs1801272 (c.479T&gt;A/p.L160H), with effect size of 0.68 CPD (N = 66,380, <italic>P</italic> = 1.1E-4) [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. rs1137115 was nominally significantly associated with lung cancer in a meta-GWAS database, adding to existing evidence that other <italic>CYP2A6</italic> variants contribute to lung cancer risk (<xref rid="pone.0126113.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>). The functional effects of rs4803381 and rs1137115, i.e., reduced transcription, protein level and activity [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126113.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] suggest that <italic>CYP2A6</italic> variation that influences regulation may be more important than <italic>CYP2A6</italic> non-synonymous variants that directly influence enzyme activity, e.g., rs1801272, but with lower prevalence [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p>
        <p>The validated <italic>CYP2A6</italic> SNPs were not associated with the clinically relevant outcome of abstinence in all trial participants, adjusted for pharmacotherapy. However, when we performed analyses stratified by pharmacotherapy, we observed interesting effect sizes in several smaller strata, including trending associations with increased abstinence in individuals randomized to NRT patch, and nonminally significant decreased abstinence in individuals randomized to chronic bupropion. The former result is consistent with reported results in individuals from two trials [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126113.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] analyzed together here, with the influence of <italic>CYP2A6</italic> activity on abstinence previously evaluated using the biochemical NMR [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], or the CYP2A6 activity model [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In our analysis of indivdiuals randomized to NRT patch from two trials [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0126113.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], we find that a single <italic>CYP2A6</italic> SNP is a statistically trending predictor where reduced nicotine metabolism implies increased nicotine plasma levels and increased abstinence. The latter result in individuals randomized to chronic bupropion therapy reaches our <italic>a priori</italic> nominally statistically significant threshold but is of uncertain clinical significance due to the small size of the pharmacotherapy group and multiple pharmacotherapy groups examined. A speculative interpretation might suggest that linkage disequilibrium between rs4803381 and <italic>CYP2B6</italic> SNPs that influence expression or activity might influence six month abstinence in indivduals undergoing chronic treatment with bupropion. Interaction between <italic>CYP2A6</italic> and <italic>CYP2B6</italic> variants in association with nicotine metabolism has been reported [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. <italic>CYP2B6</italic> SNPs that influence bupropion metabolism also influence abstinence in individuals at six months in individuals treated with bupropion for 10 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and linkage disequilbrium between relevant <italic>CYP2A6</italic> and <italic>CYP2B6</italic> alleles is low [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. <italic>CYP2B6</italic> association with smoking heaviness has been reported at robust statistical significance (rs7260329, <italic>P</italic> = 6E-6) in a genome-wide scan [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Mechanistic understanding of the potential association of rs4803381 and six month abstinence in individuals randomized to chronic bupropion treatment awaits replication and more data to permit testing of <italic>CYP2A6</italic> and <italic>CYP2B6</italic> metabolic and treatment outcome hypotheses.</p>

        <title>Limitations</title>
        <p>In this study, we did not identify the monooxygenase gene <italic>FMO3</italic> in our Stage I meta-analysis; <italic>FMO3</italic> haplotypes were previously associated with the ratio of cotinine to the sum of nicotine and cotinine in a laboratory study [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], with CPD in dependent smokers [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and with the NMR among slow metabolizers [<xref rid="pone.0126113.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Future work should include haplotype and diplotype analyses to evaluate the joint influence of multiple variants. Limitations of DMET Plus array gene coverage contributed to the inability to identify some DMET gene variants previously associated with nicotine metabolism. Finally, cytochrome P450 SNPs were over-represented among DMET SNPs that failed quality control thresholds in Stage II of our analysis, suggesting that methods that more effectively interrogate cytochrome P450 loci variation may enable further analyses of NMR variance and related phenotypes at these loci. Significant <italic>CYP2A6</italic> SNP associations with CPD, with prospective abstinence by pharmacotherapy, and with lung cancer were <italic>post-hoc</italic> and were not replicated in this study. In addition, findings from analyses of treatment-seeking cigarette smokers may not generalize to all tobacco product smokers.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>In this two-stage scan of DMET gene variation association with the NMR, we utilized two of the largest laboratory-based studies of nicotine metabolism to nominate DMET genes and SNPs, and eight randomized controlled trials of smoking cessation therapies and a lung cancer meta-GWAS database, to validate novel SNP associations with the NMR and to explore associations with related phenotypes. We ranked DMET candidate genes and SNPs by their association with the laboratory study NMR using a single model. We validated association of <italic>CYP2A6</italic> SNPs with a similar phenotype, the clinical trial-based pretreatment NMR. This suggests that multiple <italic>CYP2A6</italic> polymorphisms and non-genetic covariates will improve the predictive power of CYP2A6 activity models and support a continued focus on CYP2A6 activity models for use where phenotypic measures of nicotine metabolites are not available.</p>
      <p>Enhanced knowledge of the genes that influence nicotine metabolism, smoking behaviors and clinical outcomes will help to characterize the risks from gene variants on smoking behaviors and smoking-attributable disease, identify novel biomarkers for therapeutic efficacy, and novel targets for the development of smoking cessation therapies. Based on this analysis and additional studies cited, <italic>CYP2A6</italic> SNPs account for large fractions of the variance of the NMR, smaller fractions of the variance of cigarette consumption, and influence risk for lung cancer, but do not account for other nicotine dependence factors. This study does not provide guidance on the use of individual DMET SNPs to assign clinical treatment for tobacco dependence as the findings of interest in this study were unreplicated. Research must continue to improve our understanding of factors influencing tobacco product exposures and attributable disease, to develop improved interventions, and to protect the public health.</p>
