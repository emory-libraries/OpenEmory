          LEGAL NOTE:
          This form has two slightly different modes. Admin users will get a
          "legal_statement" selector that requires them to select between
          "author" and "admin" upload, defaulting to admin. Other users will
          see only author mode. This mode is used to note in the repository
          which legal statement the user agreed to at upload. Due to its
          legal repercussions, it must be handled carefully.

          <div class="clear"></div>

          <p>My use of the OpenEmory self-deposit method confirms that
             I grant to Emory University the non-exclusive, perpetual license
              to preserve and reproduce the work, and to display, distribute
               and make the work publicly available without charge from 
               the open access repository OpenEmory, or any successor 
               initiative based at Emory, in any format.
          </p>
          <p>I represent and warrant to Emory that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I have the right to submit the work to OpenEmory and 
              to grant Emory the license above, or I have unrestricted 
              permission from the copyright owner, such as a publisher, 
              for the work to be distributed in an open access repository.
            </li>
            <li>Distribution from OpenEmory of the work does not infringe 
              or violate any copyright or other rights of a publisher or 
              other third party.</li>
            <li>If the work contains material for which I do not hold copyright, 
              such as images, I have obtained all necessary rights for the work 
              and the material to be distributed in OpenEmory.
            </li>
            <li>If the work was prepared jointly with other authors, I am 
              granting the license above on their behalf as well as my own, 
              and am authorized to do so.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I understand that I will have the option of specifying an embargo 
            date to comply with publisher or funder policies, and Emory will 
            delay making the work publicly available from OpenEmory until that date. 
            I understand that I may request to have public access to my work 
            restricted by removing public display to my work, and that Emory 
            may remove my work from public display if Emory deems distribution is inappropriate, 
            such as violating the rights of a third party.</p>
            <p>I understand that this license is non-exclusive and does not 
              prevent me from entering into similar arrangements with other 
              parties or from exercising any rights that I may have in the work. 
              However, I understand that I may need to inform subsequent publishers 
              or others that I have granted this license to distribute my work in OpenEmory.
